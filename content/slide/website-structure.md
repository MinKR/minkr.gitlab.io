## UX Patterns

There are some common User Experience patterns used to give a "good enough" start
to your site.

Different patterns are useful for different functions.

* Z Pattern - Information followed by an action
* F Pattern - Displaying lists of information



### Z Pattern

Use this pattern when there's plenty of space between elements and you
have an action at the end.
