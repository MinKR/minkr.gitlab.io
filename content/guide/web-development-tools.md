# Development Tools

The tools you use can drastically affect how difficult and time consuming
the task may be. Using great tools and knowing how to effectively use them can be
critical. This is just as true when chopping down a tree or when coding a website.
You should choose the best tool for the job.

## Available Options

Several options for development tools are avialable. Here are the most popular text editors:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - recommended
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

## Learning to use the tools

Choosing the right tool is important but you must also learn to use it. There are a
few common things across all text editors that you should learn to use. Keyboard
Shortcuts listed are for VS Code and may or may not work on other editors. You should
look up the keyboard shortcut for your editor.

* Command Palette - Mac: CMD(⌘) + Shift + P - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + P

Allows you to type anything you could possibly want to do and apply it in an instant.
Here you can get to customizing the theme, editting your keyboard shortcuts or snippets,
installing packages/extensions and much more. Anything you can access through the menus,
you can access through the command palette, and more!

* Go to / File switcher - Mac: CMD(⌘) + P - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + P

Allows you to switch to other files by typing their names or parts of the name.

* Hide / Show Sidebar - Mac: CMD(⌘) + B - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + B

Hides and shows the sidebar - useful when you need more space to see code.

* Open to the side - Mac: CMD(⌘) + \ - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + \

Opens the same file to the side so you can work on two files at the same time.

* Select next occurrence - Mac: CMD(⌘) + D - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + D

Selects the next occurrence of the selected characters and adds another cursor there.
You can then type/edit multiple locations at the same time.

* Find across entire project - Mac: CMD(⌘) + Shift + F - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + F
