There are 4 types of requests that a user can make:

GET — receives data
POST — creates data
PUT — updates data
DELETE — deletes data

APIs Instead of views being written in HTML, views can just send data back (usually in the form of JSON). This then makes whatever you’re building into an API. There are some commonly used design patterns like REST APIs but I won’t go into that.
