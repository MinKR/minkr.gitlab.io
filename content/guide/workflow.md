Packages are important in development. If someone has already written it, you shouldn’t have to. There are several package managers for both front end and back end development. 

Scss and es6

Since it takes a somewhat long time for new features to be supported by browsers, people have created libraries that allow you to create code using the features and it will compile it into code that the browser understands. This allows you to use advanced features without having to wait for support.

Testing

There are several ways of doing testing and you should definitely make sure your code is covered with tests. 

Workflow managers

Gulp and grunt are two of the most popular workflow managers. They do all sorts of things to make sure your workflow is as easy as just running one terminal command. With things like instantly refreshing the browser when you save a file and compiling and minifying your code, your workflow becomes a breeze.
