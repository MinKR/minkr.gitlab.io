Welcome to the Full Stack Web Collection. A min(KR) collection is a group of guides that when combined will provide you with the
minimum knowledge required to perform a large task or goal.

# Full Stack Web Development

Well, what is Full Stack Web Development? let's start with the end of the term, "Web Development".

## Web Development

Web development is the development
of web products like websites and web apps. You've probably visited many websites on the internet
like Google, Youtube, Facebook and so on. Web Development is how these websites are built. Web
Development consists of two main portions, Front End and Back End. Full Stack means you can cover both.

## Front End

You can think of the Front End portion of Web Development as the part the user sees. 
Front End includes the design and the functional aspects that the user sees.

## Back End

You can think of the Back End portion of Web Development as the part the user doesn't see.
This includes databases (where you store the user and application information (data) ),
the business logic and the server.

## Full Stack

Full Stack covers both Front End and Back End. This means it covers everything from the design
of the site to setting up and connecting to the server that runs the business logic. Being a
Full Stack developer means you can build a site from A to Z. You can do it all! Let's get started.

# The Collection

In the collection, we will go over some general programming concepts to make sure you're up to
speed on the basics. We'll then cover the development tools you can use to build websites and
web apps. Then we'll get into the core materials of Front and Back End development. Each section
has a detailed text guide that covers the min(KR) as well as a set of slides that can provide a good
summary for the section. In case you're already familiar with specific concepts you can get a
quick review by looking through the slides.
