Welcome to min(KR). min(KR) is a place where you can learn enough to get started working
on the projects you dream of pursuing. min(KR) assumes no prior knowledge and aims to
bring you up to speed on all the knowledge you need to get started. Getting started
means you enough so you can easily learn on your own or learn from experts /
professionals without feeling like you're in way over your head.

min(KR) is split into multiple collections of knowledge. Each collection covers several
topics that when combined together provide the knowledge to work on an application.
Each topic covers a small subset of knowledge that is still independently complete.
This means that if you're interested in a specific topic you can cover that post
and you will still learn the minimum knowledge required for it.

You will not become an expert through reading min(KR), there are other resources that
are better equiped to do so. Each collection will mention a few resources that you
can use to continue learning and expanding your knowledge in the field.

That's enough for the introduction, let's get started! Check out the collections, posts
and slides below!
